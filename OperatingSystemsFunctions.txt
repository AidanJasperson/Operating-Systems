One function of an operating system is to manage a computers resources, such as memory via RAM and hard drive. The operating system must keep track of and know how many memory locations there are in the computer. Another crucial piece of memory management is CPU management, providing the ability for the CPU to retrieve information from storange and load it into main memory for whatever programs or processes need them currently. 
Another essential function of an operating system is to provide a user-interface. The purpose of the user inerface is to provide the ability for the user of the computer to communicate with the computer and control or alter it's functions and processes. There are different types of user interfaces, they may be graphic or text based, or both.

The operating creates a kernel when the user chooses to run an application, which begins the process of allocating memory and computer resources for the application.
